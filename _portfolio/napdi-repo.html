title: "Natural Product-Drug Interaction (NaPDI) Research Data Repository"
excerpt: "An open-source, publicly accessible data repository where researchers can access scientific results, raw data, and recommended approaches to optimally assess the clinical significance of pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (PK-NPDIs).<br/>My role in developing this site with a multidisciplinary team involved curating and designing its backend PostgreSQL database. I also conducted user testing interviews with pharmacology experts to identify UI-related preferences, and helped implement new use cases and information needs based on these interviews.

An open-source, publicly accessible data repository where researchers can access scientific results, raw data, and recommended approaches to optimally assess the clinical significance of pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (PK-NPDIs).
<br/>My role in developing this site with a multidisciplinary team involved curating and designing its backend PostgreSQL database. I also conducted user testing interviews with pharmacology experts to identify UI-related preferences, and helped implement new use cases and information needs based on these interviews. Features I contributed included leveraging my SQL knowledge with Node.js implementation toward representing natural product experiment results through transforming and presenting principal component analysis (PCA) model results into interactive 3-dimensional plots.
