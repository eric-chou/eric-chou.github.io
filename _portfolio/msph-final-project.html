title: "Modeling the Effect of Public Transit Accessibility on Diabetic Health Outcomes in Georgia"
excerpt: "With DFU-related lower extremity amputations as the adverse outcome, we aimed to model geographic associations between amputations and measures of public transit usage and accessibility... Across both the whole state of Georgia and within metro-Atlanta, accessibility of public transit and overall walkability of communities were significant predictors for observing fewer amputations, after adjusting for each ZCTA’s poverty level, personal vehicle availability, health insurance coverage, and primary care travel distance.<br/><a href='/files/2022 MSPH project poster.pdf' target='_blank'><img src='/images/msph_poster_forest_plot.png'></a>"

With DFU-related lower extremity amputations as the adverse outcome, we aimed to model geographic associations between amputations and measures of public transit usage and accessibility... Across both the whole state of Georgia and within metro-Atlanta, accessibility of public transit and overall walkability of communities were significant predictors for observing fewer amputations, after adjusting for each ZCTA’s poverty level, personal vehicle availability, health insurance coverage, and primary care travel distance.
