  - Master of Science in Public Health -- Biostatistics -- Expected Graduation: May 2022
  - Capstone Project: "Investigating the Effect of Public Transit Accessibility on Diabetic Health Outcomes in Georgia"
    + Summarized  mobility options and healthcare access in the state of Georgia by ZIP code by compiling publicly available datasets of MARTA public transportation stops, walkability, census data, and access to primary care or hospital locations
    + Explored potential associations between transportation vulnerability and adverse diabetic health outcomes using ArcGIS mapping, Poisson regression, and Bayesian regression models with spatial random effects

Work experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant — Emory University School of Medicine, Sickle Cell Disease Research Group — September 2020 - Present
  - Collaborated on research projects related to pain in sickle cell disease through analysis of longitudinal patient data
  - Used a combination of Stata, SAS, and R for cluster-based trajectory analysis of time series data for pain scores
  - Applied predictive modeling techniques in assessing the temporal dynamics of pain in sickle cell patients via Markov models
  - Transformed large datasets of diagnosis data and longitudinal pain scores using Python and R to develop phenotypes for chronic pain and pain-related interference in sickle cell patients
  - Main Supervisor: Dr. Nitya Bakshi, MD, MS

* Systems Programmer — University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Department of Biomedical Informatics — September 2017 - August 2020
  - Collaborated with the Natural Product Drug Interactions (NaPDI) team to develop features for a [data repository](https://repo.napdi.org/). Designed and curated the repository's backend PostgreSQL database
  - Processed natural product experiment data via a combination of SQL and Node.js code to implement user needs for data visualization and interface tools for the NaPDI data repository
  - Collected qualitative data points and user experience feedback to inform development of the NaPDI data repository through interactive interviews with pharmacological professionals 
  - Developed a contextual drug-drug interaction alerting system to enhance clinical decision making in collaboration with pharmacology experts. Implemented algorithms for generating individualized warnings based on patient data using JBoss Drools
  - Operationalized clinical decision making algorithms using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) queries by building upon an open source OMOP on FHIR implementation
  - Performed large scale retrospective analyses on encounter-based patient data through transforming, loading, and subsetting an Amazon Redshift database via SQL and R
  - Main Supervisor: Dr. Richard Boyce, PhD

* Research Analyst — University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Department of Biomedical Informatics — January 2015 - September 2017
  - Analyzed pharmacology research questions using SQL and Python to process and query large datasets of patient records under the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model Version 5
  - Applied database and scripting skills via loading, refining, and analyzing Medicare patient data toward implementation of an EHR-based nursing home intervention to prevent adverse drug events
  - Implemented Natural Language Processing methods and regular expressions in Python to parse unstructured clinical notes
  - Main Supervisor: Dr. Richard Boyce, PhD

* Research Assistant — University of Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry — January 2013 - May 2013
  - Analyzed potential effects of hypertension on the brain in collaboration with a multidisciplinary group of colleagues in a psychophysiology lab
  - Presented spatial data visualizations and findings of brain volume comparisons in patients with sleep apnea
  - Main Supervisor: Dr. J. Richard Jennings, PhD
