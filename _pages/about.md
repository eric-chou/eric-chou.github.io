Greetings! My name is Eric Chou. I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as a Master's degree in biostatistics at Emory University.

I am an experienced coder in end-to-end data analytics, working closely with a variety of large datasets throughout my career. I greatly enjoy the the problem-solving of prying datasets into shape for statistical analysis and interpretation, and I consider myself a very flexible, eager learner in applying novel methods and approaches in such processes.

I consider myself fortunate to have worked across multiple subject areas for which I hold great personal interest. Throughout my academic and professional pursuits, I have worked with biomedical data and clinical data. Currently, I am a data quality analyst with the Research & Analysis Department at Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA).
