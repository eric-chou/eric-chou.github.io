Greetings! I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and I moved to Pittsburgh for my undergraduate education in bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh. I have consistently been working on several research projects with Pitt faculty in a variety capacities during my undergraduate career and afterward. Since graduating in 2016, I have continued working in Pittsburgh for Pitt's Department of Biomedical Informatics.
