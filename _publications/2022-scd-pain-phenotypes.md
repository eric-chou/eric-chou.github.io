excerpt: 'There is limited understanding of pain, psychological comorbidities associated with pain and HRQoL following transplantation for SCD. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of collecting data on pain, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), HRQoL and experimental pain sensitivity using quantitative sensory testing (QST), and to compare these before and following HCT in patients with SCD. We hypothesized that there would be a decrease in pain burden following HCT and improvement in pain-associated psychological comorbidity.'

## Abstract

### Introduction

There is limited understanding of pain, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological factors, and experimental pain sensitivity before and following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD).

### Methods

Individuals aged 8 years and older, English speaking, and scheduled for a HCT were invited to participate in an observational study where they completed assessments of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative interviews before and around 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT. An optional substudy of experimental pain sensitivity before and around 6 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-HCT was also offered.

### Results

Data from eight participants (median age 13.5 years, 25% female) with sickle cell anemia (SCA) or similarly severe genotype, and successful donor-derived erythropoiesis post-HCT are reported. We found that collection of pain, PROs, psychological factors, and qualitative data were feasible in the context of HCT. We found moderate to large differences in pain and some PROs between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but only some differences were statistically significant. We found moderate to large differences in pressure pain threshold and moderate differences in cold pain threshold between baseline to 1 year and baseline to 2 year post-HCT based on effect sizes, but these differences were not statistically significant. Qualitative data indicated an improvement in pain and HRQoL post-HCT.

### Conclusion

This study provides a framework for the conduct of multimodal pain assessments before and after HCT, which is feasible but faced with unique barriers.
